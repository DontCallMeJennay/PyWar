# PyWar
## "War" card game written in Python and visualized with Eel

## Gameplay
* Two players, one human, one computer
* In each round, each player plays the top card in their hand
* The player who plays the highest card adds the two cards to their reserve pile
* If the cards are equal, a WAR sequence occurs
* * Each player plays three face-down cards and one face-up card; the player whose fourth card is highest takes the entire pile
* When all cards in a hand are played, the player picks up the reserve pile, and the card count for both sides is announced
* When one player has zero cards in hand AND zero cards in reserve, the other player wins
